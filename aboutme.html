      Hello! My name is Randell Lapid. I'm currently a Computer Science major at
      CSUF. I'm currently learning about web development and how websites are
      created and maintained on the internet. In my free time, I like to play
      many games, ranging from FPS to RPGs to open world and many others. The
      current games that I'm playing are Genshin and Honkai Star Rail.(I may be
      a bit deep into the gacha rabbit hole) I also like playing a bit of Bloons
      TD 6, Terraria, Minecraft, and Call of Duty Zombies mode. I also like
      watching tv shows and anime, but mainly go to Youtube for watching
      creators that I enjoy as well as learning more about topics that seem
      interesting and other random videos that may pop up on my homepage.
    </p>

      Some of the programming languages I learned about are C++ and Java. Also a
      bit of SQL. Currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript in this class. I
      would like to learn other programming languages such as Python and C#.
